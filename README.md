# Machine-Learning
In recent years, speech emotion recognition is playing a vital role in today’s digital world. In our project, we considered RAVDESS, TESS and SAVEE Datasets for training the model. We considered 10 different Machine Learning Algorithms to find out their accuracies. After that, we cleaned the dataset by applying mask function to remove unwanted background noise, so that we can increase the accuracy by again applying all 10 algorithms on this clean speech datasets to find the best algorithm. Finally, by using that algorithm’s model, we counted the number of files of each of the emotion in each dataset.
