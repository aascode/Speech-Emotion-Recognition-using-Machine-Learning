# Machine-Learning
In recent years, speech emotion recognition is playing a vital role in today’s digital world. In our project, we considered RAVDESS Dataset for training the model. We considered 10 different Machine Learning Algorithms to find out which is the best algorithm among those by considering their accuracies. After that, we cleaned the dataset by applying mask function to remove unwanted background noise, so that we can increase the accuracy and again applied all 10 algorithms on this clean speech dataset to verify which is the best algorithm. Finally, by using that algorithm’s model, we tested a sample audio file to predict its emotion.
